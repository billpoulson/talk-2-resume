	👋 I’m Bill, a seasoned Senior Software Engineer with extensive experience in development, architecture, and DevOps. My demonstrated expertise covers a wide range of technologies, including .NET/CORE/Framework, Angular,  C#, React, ASP.NET, MVC, Entity Framework, SQL, Node.js, JavaScript, Kotlin, Python, shell, and more -- I’m always learning. I have proficiency in both front- and back-end development, cloud computing, database management, and DevOps practices, evidenced by use of GitHub Actions, Terraform, Docker, and Google Cloud/Azure.


🚀 I began coding at thirteen, creating an inventory web app for a computer parts store. This early start laid the foundation for my competence in green-field projects and a lifelong passion for problem solving and technology innovation. Over my professional career's two decades, I began in technical support roles, quickly transitioned into application development, grew into senior engineer positions, and now also actively mentor junior developers in their success.

Caleb Delnay, Lead Software Architect at Gordon Food Service


Bill is a highly skilled and technical software engineer. He brings an architectural mindset and a deep understanding of software to the craft. While many projects trip over the libraries and frameworks they use, Bill truly knows how to apply the full potential of such tools, and repair codebases that have gone astray. He's adept at designing useful abstractions that simplify the lives of other developers, making codebases more maintainable and easier to work with, which means more throughput in building features for the business. Bill is a multiplier of productivity for the developers he works with, elevating the entire team's performance, acting as a mentor for developers of all skill levels, and cracking the shell on the hard problems that stump others.


Bill's expertise spans a wide range of areas, like dependency injection, reactivity, cache strategies, message bus design, and performance optimization (to name a few), along with a swath of programming languages, libraries, and frameworks, as well as the seamless application of these concepts across both the back-end and front-end. Bill doesn't shy away from understanding the business challenge at hand and seeks to find a well blended technical approach. If I wanted a problem solved well with a balance between engineering correctness, scope, and cost, I'd ask Bill to design the solution.


Ankit Srivastava, Architect at CoStar Real Estate Manager


I had the pleasure of working with Bill for six months as a Senior UI/UX Engineer contractor. Bill quickly solved complex problems and delivered innovative solutions that greatly contributed to our project success. His expertise in Angular is impressive, consistently producing clean, efficient, and high-quality code. Bill also played a key role in suggesting improvements to our UI/UX coding standards, ensuring better design consistency and maintainability. He’s a strong communicator and collaborator, always working to improve the user experience. I highly recommend Bill for any team looking for a skilled and proactive Senior Engineer.


Matthew Jansen, Senior Director of Strategy at Gordon Food Service


Bill is a talented senior software developer who combines strategic thinking with a strong work ethic. During our time working together, he demonstrated the value of smart software architecture and intelligent scoping between an application's front- and back-ends. Bill navigated complex data interactions during our transition from legacy systems to SAP, where key definitions were constantly in flux. His ability to abstract functionality ensured our software remained adaptable throughout this change. 


He effectively advocated for sound technical direction and wasn't hesitant to engage in constructive debate, even if his views differed from the majority. This often led to better overall decisions. His maturity and ability to respect team choices, even when personally disagreeing, made him an asset to the team dynamic. Bill willingly mentored developers on our team and created comprehensive documentation that remains a valuable resource for onboarding new members. His desire to deliver results stems from an admirable work ethic, and he was always a source of realistic, honest feedback. Compared to other senior developers I've worked with, Bill's breadth of experience allows him to quickly identify the core of a problem and develop an effective solution. He has an exceptional ability to learn new things quickly, making him adaptable in the face of uncertainty. I appreciate Bill's contributions to our enterprise-grade software, now used by thousands of customers. I'm confident he would be a valuable addition to any software development team.


Zachary Arens, Web and Mobile Developer at Kyros Digital


Bill is one of those software engineers that just operates on a higher level. While others are still getting their heads around a problem, Bill is ready with the right design patterns and architectural solutions to scale the project. He has been an invaluable asset to my growth as a software engineer, always pushing me towards my next skill development.
